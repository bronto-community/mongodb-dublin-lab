# MongoDB Dublin: AI Observability & Monitoring

Bronto's talk and guided build at **MongoDB Dublin** (Building 2, 1 Ballsbridge, Shelbourne Road, Dublin 4) for
Dublin AI Week, hosted by Give(a)Go, on **Wednesday 7 October 2026**. Event page: <https://luma.com/observability>.

- **Lab guide:** <https://mongodb-dublin-lab.vercel.app> (source: [`site/app/page.mdx`](site/app/page.mdx))

## Run of show

| Time (Dublin, pm) | What | Deck |
|---|---|---|
| 6:00 | Doors, food, networking | title slide up |
| 6:30 | Welcome and build-session briefing (Give(a)Go) | |
| 6:40 | Harshit Mehta, MongoDB: "AI Observability in Action: MongoDB Atlas OTel Metrics Sink" (talk only) | |
| 6:55 | **Bronto talk**, 20 min, with a live Bronto + Claude demo | slides 1–13 |
| 7:15 | **Guided build**, 75 min: setup + six steps | slides 14–21 |
| 8:30 | Builds, lessons and questions | slide 22 |
| 8:45 | Food and networking; 9:00 close | slide 23 |

The build delivers what the event page promises:

- **Trace model, agent and tool activity:** step 2, where the agent sends its own traces to the attendee's Bronto.
- **Connect application signals with database metrics:** step 4, Atlas metrics through Bronto's metrics API, plus
  slow-query logs.
- **Investigate a production issue to its root cause:** steps 3, 5 and 6.

## What's here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`slides/`](slides) | Slidev deck. `npm ci && npx slidev`; publish with `./deploy.sh` |
| [`site/`](site) | The lab guide (Next.js, static, one MDX page). `npm ci && npm run dev` |
| [`agent/`](agent) | The lab's own AI SRE (Strands), one image with `AGENT_STEP=1..6`, published as `ghcr.io/bronto-community/mongodb-lab-agent` |
| [`storefront/`](storefront) | Builds `bronto-community/storefront-mongo`: Severin's Storefront up to v3.1.0, moved to MongoDB Atlas (v4.0.0), and the v4.1.0 release with the incident |
| [`harness/`](harness) | One EC2 instance running Storefront, its load and an OpenTelemetry Collector that forwards Storefront's telemetry to the shared Bronto demo org. It also relays Atlas's mongod log export: Caddy on 443 (TLS and a relay token) in front of the Collector, which turns each mongod line into one Bronto event with its fields. Atlas sends its metrics to Bronto directly |

## The incident

Storefront's shop-checkout and shop-catalog store their data in an Atlas M10 cluster with about 1.5M orders. Release
v4.1.0 has three commits, and one of them adds a query on `orders` that no index covers. Every checkout then scans the
collection. Here is what each signal shows:

| Signal | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Traces | A slow `storefront.aggregate` span on `orders` under `POST /checkout` (about 1 s, up from 5 ms for the insert) |
| Atlas metrics | Query targeting and operation latency jump |
| Atlas logs | `Slow query … COLLSCAN` |
| GitHub | The commit, with its misleading message |

Don't share the details with attendees before 8:30. The speaker notes on slides 21–22 have the answer.

### Organiser checklist

**One-off setup**

1. **Atlas:** an M10 cluster called `storefront` and a database user with readWrite on `storefront`.
   - Add the harness's Elastic IP in Network Access.
   - Project → Integrations → OpenTelemetry:
     - **metrics** to `https://ingestion.eu.bronto.io/v1/metrics`;
     - **log export** (`mongod`) to the harness relay, `https://<elastic-ip-with-dashes>.sslip.io/v1/logs`.

     Metrics use the header `x-bronto-api-key` set to the ingestion key. The log export uses `X-Relay-Token` set to the relay token, `RELAY_TOKEN` in the gitignored `harness/.env`.
2. **Storefront repo:**
   - Run `sh storefront/build-history.sh /tmp/storefront-mongo`.
   - Push it to `bronto-community/storefront-mongo` with `git push -u origin main --tags`.
3. **Harness:** run `set -a; . harness/.env; set +a`, then `harness/deploy.sh` with `MONGODB_URI` set.
4. **Shared demo org:** the EU org. Its public "ReadOnly" key has the Lab read (logs + metrics) role, so it covers both MCP and the metrics API.
5. **Agent image:**
   ```bash
   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t ghcr.io/bronto-community/mongodb-lab-agent --push agent
   ```
   Make the package public on GHCR.
6. **Deck and guide:** run `slides/deploy.sh`, and deploy `site/` to its own Vercel project, `mongodb-dublin-lab`.

**Pre-event email**

Approved guests get setup guidance before the event. Ask them to arrive with:

- Docker installed
- a Gemini API key
- a Bronto account and its ingestion key
- the `ai-sre-issues` repo and its token
- `docker pull ghcr.io/bronto-community/mongodb-lab-agent` already done

**On the night**

The event's times are Dublin time, Irish Standard Time (UTC+1). The harness runs on **UTC**, so its hourly timers
fire at 19:00 and 19:15 Dublin time (18:00 and 18:15 UTC). Left alone, they would roll the incident back at 20:00
Dublin time, in the middle of step 5. Instead, switch the incident by hand from a laptop with
[`harness/night.sh`](harness/night.sh), which runs the commands on the instance over SSM:

| Dublin (IST) | UTC | Run | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| before 19:00 | before 18:00 | `./night.sh load 0.5` | 0.5 checkouts a second, so the bad release costs about 1 s per checkout. At 2, the M10 saturates within minutes and checkouts queue for minutes |
| 19:00 | 18:00 | `./night.sh baseline` | Hourly timers off, good release `v4.0.0` live. 19:00–19:30 is the quiet baseline |
| 19:30 | 18:30 | `./night.sh release` | `v4.1.0` ships and checkout gets slow. Leave it running through the build |
| after 20:45 | after 19:45 | `./night.sh restore` | Good release back, hourly timers on again |

Run each from `harness/` with `AWS_PROFILE=bronto`, after `aws sso login --profile bronto`.
`./night.sh status` shows which release is live and the timers.

## Dashboards

[`harness/dashboards/create_dashboards.py`](harness/dashboards/create_dashboards.py) builds two dashboards in the shared demo org, for the talk's live demo:

- **Storefront × Atlas — checkout**: checkout latency and requests, the release running, the MongoDB calls under checkout, Atlas query targeting and CPU, and the mongod slow-query log. One time axis, top to bottom.
- **Atlas — storefront (M10)**: Atlas's own Metrics-tab charts (opcounters, query targeting, op execution time, connections, CPU, memory, disk, network, replication lag, queues), from the OTel Metrics Sink.

Atlas sends serverStatus counters as ever-growing gauges, and Bronto has no derivative function. So each counter is two queries per bucket, MAX and MIN, plus a formula for the difference. The script's docstring explains the details. One definition takes at most six queries, and a formula expression at most 100 characters.

```bash
BRONTO_API_KEY=... python3 harness/dashboards/create_dashboards.py --validate   # read-only dry run
BRONTO_API_KEY=... python3 harness/dashboards/create_dashboards.py              # create
BRONTO_API_KEY=... python3 harness/dashboards/create_dashboards.py --delete     # remove, from state.json
```

Creating needs a key with dashboard write access; the public read-only key is enough for `--validate`. The IDs of what it created are in `harness/dashboards/state.json`.

## Provisioned (5 October)

- **Atlas:** org "Stephen's Org", project `mongodb-dublin` (`6ac39bb035b2838e26badbdf`).
  - Cluster `storefront`: M10, AWS eu-west-1, MongoDB 8.0.
  - Database user `storefront`, with readWrite on the `storefront` database.
  - The password is in the gitignored `harness/.env`.
- **Atlas → Bronto metrics:** a custom OTEL metric integration that sends MongoDB and hardware metrics to `https://ingestion.eu.bronto.io/v1/metrics`. The test metric arrived in the shared EU org.
- **Bronto:** ingestion key "mongodb-dublin ingestion (Storefront + Atlas)", which expires 4 November 2026. It's in the gitignored `harness/.env`.
- **GitHub:** `bronto-community/storefront-mongo`, with the built history and tags.
- **Bronto public read-only key** ("ReadOnly", shared with other Bronto labs in the same org): moved from the built-in SearchApi role to a custom API role, **Lab read (logs + metrics)**.
  - Permissions: `logs_read`, `logs_read_pii` and `dashboards_read`.
  - `dashboards_read` is what Bronto checks for `GET /metrics` and `POST /timeseries/search`; Bronto has no metrics permission of its own.
  - MCP still works with it.

## Open questions

- **Atlas log export goes through the harness relay.** Bronto's `/v1/logs` accepts only an exact `application/x-protobuf` or `application/json` Content-Type. Bronto's base endpoint stores a whole OTLP batch as one flattened event, and Atlas's scheduled exports never arrived there anyway: only its tests did.
  - The relay accepts any OTLP encoding and keeps slow queries, warnings and errors.
  - Each record becomes its own event in `mongodb-dublin / atlas-mongod`, with `msg`, `attr.ns`, `attr.planSummary` and `attr.docsExamined` as fields.
  - Configure it through the Admin API (`PUT /groups/{id}/logIntegrations/{id}`, type `OTEL_LOG_EXPORT`). The UI's edit form re-sends the masked header value when it tests.
- The values on the GenAI vocabulary slide (model, tokens, tool name) are illustrative until the agent has run on Gemini against the incident. The checkout trace slide uses two real harness traces.
- Load (`CHECKOUT_RPS`) and seed size (`SEED_ORDERS`): tune them so the bad release costs about 1 s per checkout without saturating the M10.
